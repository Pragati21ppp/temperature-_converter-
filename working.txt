## Working

- Inside HTML file I have made 3 divs with different ids and 3 inputs inside it with type number and placeholder

* In the style.css
  - first I have removed the default styling by margin 0, padding 0, box-sizing: border box
  * than give the border-top and border-bottom to the middle one 
  * then put the input[type=number] give it width to be 100%

* In the App.js
    * First I have used [celciusInput= document.querySelector("#id>input")] done this for all the three div 
    * in the celciusInput.addEventListener('input', celciusToFahrenheightAndKelvin);
    * celciusToFahrenheightAndKelvin is a function that will be called to as soon as number is input
    * this function will convert and put the value in remaing two input value
